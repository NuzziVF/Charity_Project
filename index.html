    <h1>Donate to the cause</h1>
    <p>
      Charities fail all of the time and there is no-one there to support them.
      Send your Money here and we will help out the charities that fail the
      most. Some might say that they are bad ideas but we believe they are just
      to special to understand.
    </p>
    <h2>Where is our money going?</h2>
    <p>
      We guarantee 100% of your money goes to the charities listed and we even
      provide the name of the charity your money goes too.
